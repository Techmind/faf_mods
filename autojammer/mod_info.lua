description = "Makes jamming re-apply occassionaly by disabling/enabling it each 5 seconds, so 1 over flying scout wont completly negate it. Will auto-enable jamming so might be bad for your E economy if you build lots of stuff with jamming. Might make it overpowered. But sacu's jammign costs 1k metal so i think its a fair deal)"
